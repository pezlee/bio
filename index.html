<h2>💡 About PEZ</h2>

<p>I began my journey in a global BPO firm as a <strong>frontline agent</strong> and rose through the ranks to <strong>training and QA</strong> roles. Recognized for my performance, I was recruited by a client to join their in-house operations team—marking the start of a dynamic career spanning leadership in QA, training, and strategic project delivery. </p>

<p>Following the successful establishment of QA operations, I transitioned to <strong>Operations Manager</strong>, where I oversaw BPO vendor management and led several impactful initiatives. Notable milestones include launching the Yahoo! Taiwan Auction App, creating user-focused communication materials, and introducing the platform's first Video Help Center. I also co-developed Yapee, a pioneering e-commerce escrow service that set a new industry benchmark.</p>

<p>Motivated by a passion for team development and service excellence, I went on to establish Shopee's TQA team, which earned the prestigious <strong>Service Excellence Award</strong>. I later led the implementation of the <strong>CS Ticketing System</strong> and introduced the <strong>Internet Call</strong> feature, significantly improving support accessibility and user satisfaction.</p>

<p>These experiences have shaped my commitment to building meaningful customer experiences through innovation and collaboration. I'm always open to connecting with professionals who share a passion for elevating service excellence.</p>
