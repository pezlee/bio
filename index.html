<h2 id="about">🐠 About</h2>

<p>My journey began at a leading BPO firm, where I started as a frontline agent and advanced into training and quality assurance roles. Recognized for my performance, I was referred by a client to join their in-house team, becoming a founding member of a specialized QA group. In this role, I collaborated with teams across North and Southeast Asia to uphold and elevate service standards.</p>

<p>Following the successful establishment of QA operations, I transitioned to Operations Manager, where I oversaw BPO vendor management and led several impactful initiatives. Notable milestones include launching the Yahoo! Taiwan Auction App, creating user-focused communication materials, and introducing the platform's first Video Help Center. As part of a collaboration with CTBC Bank, I helped launch Yapee, the e-commerce industry's first escrow service. It aims to combat fraud and protect transaction integrity for both buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>Motivated by a passion for team development and service excellence, I went on to establish Shopee's TQA team, which earned the prestigious Service Excellence Award. I later led the implementation of the CS Ticketing System and introduced the Internet Call feature, significantly improving support accessibility and user satisfaction.</p>

<p>﻿Highlights of my journey include:</p>
<li>✅ Founding member of a global QA team, setting quality standards across Asia.</li>
<li>✅ Led the launch of the Yahoo! Taiwan Auction App and the platform's first Video Help Center.</li>
<li>✅ Co-developed Yapee, Taiwan's first e-commerce escrow service, in partnership with CTBC Bank.</li>
<li>✅ Built Shopee's TQA team from the ground up, earning the 2018 Service Excellence Award.</li>
<li>✅ Implemented a CS Ticketing System and Internet Call at Shopee to improve service accessibility.</li>

<p>These experiences have shaped my commitment to building meaningful customer experiences through innovation and collaboration, and I’m always open to connecting with professionals who share a passion for service excellence. Known for my collaborative mindset and a keen eye for process optimization, I thrive in dynamic environments that embrace continuous improvement.</p>
