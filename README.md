## 💡 About Me

I began my journey in a global BPO firm as a frontline agent and rose through the ranks to training and QA roles. Recognized for my performance, I was recruited by a client to join their in-house operations team—marking the start of a dynamic career spanning leadership in QA, training, and strategic project delivery. 

Over the course of nearly a decade at Shopee, I have progressed through key leadership roles within the Customer Service division, spanning team development, quality assurance, and large-scale project delivery. I initially built and led the Training & QA team from the ground up, designing quality frameworks and implementing data-driven improvements that significantly enhanced service performance. As the team expanded, I spearheaded its structural evolution into two specialized functions, ensuring operational scalability and long-term sustainability.

In recent years, I transitioned into a project-focused role akin to Delivery Management, overseeing the end-to-end execution of complex initiatives such as CRM transformation, ticketing system implementation, chatbot and Help Center enhancements, and internet call integration. Through strategic planning, stakeholder alignment, and agile problem-solving, I consistently deliver projects on time and in scope—driving measurable gains in service efficiency, team readiness, and customer satisfaction.
