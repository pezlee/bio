# 👋 Hello! I'm Pez!

I’m a customer experience & operations professional with a strong background in project coordination, process improvement, and quality assurance. My experience spans digital product development, cross-functional collaboration, and data-informed service design. I take pride in solving problems, optimizing workflows, and building meaningful user experiences.

🎯 Currently seeking roles in project management, customer experience, or quality assurance — ideally hybrid/remote or based in Taichung.  
🤝 Open to diverse collaboration opportunities!
