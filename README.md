# 👋 Hello! I'm Pez!

I’m a customer experience & operations professional with a strong background in project coordination, process improvement, and quality assurance. My experience spans from digital product development to cross-functional collaboration, with a proven track record of optimizing workflows and enhancing service performance.

Currently open to opportunities in project management, customer experience, or quality roles—ideally hybrid/remote or based in Taichung. Let’s connect if you’re passionate about building better user journeys and smarter operations!
